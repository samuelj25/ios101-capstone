iOS101 Capstone Project - App Brainstorming
===

## New App Ideas - List
1. Fitness Logger
    - Allows experienced and inexperienced people to search for exercises and track the weight, number of sets, and reps done. Personal bests (PBs) are also remembered, so that when the user surpasses their PB, they are notified of their achievement. There is also a rest timer that allows for the amount of rest the user allows themselves to be tracked.
2. Manga Tracker 
    - Allows people to search for mangas based on a title or genres. People can track which mangas they are interested in, currently reading, completed, or dropped. People can see reviews and rating left by other users and can deduce whether the manga is something they would want to read.
3. Group Event Planner
    - Allows users to coordinate with friend groups to plan meetups/events. Users would be able to mark their availability, suggest/plan events, RSVP, and vote to cancel plans.
4. Pomodoro Task App
    - Allows students to stay productive via the Pomodoro Technique. Students can create tasks, focus for 25-minute intervals, and take short breaks. Students can track how many tasks they got done and how many intervals it took to complete.
